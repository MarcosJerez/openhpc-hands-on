# openhpc-hands-on

This repository stores materials for the OpenHPC hands-on workshop.

Document `speed-run.txt` is a simplified, strongly-summarized version of the official OpenHPC guide, including some reordering for pedagogical purpose. Its aim is to help to instruct a OpenHPC installation workshop, being made of just commands and short comments. It is not intended in anyway to replace official documentation neither recommended for production systems.
